# pwnroom
docker container setup for pwn
> Based on LiveOverflow's https://github.com/LiveOverflow/pwn_docker_example, really handy because i use ArchLinux and pwn in CTFs is mostly better when having Ubuntu like environment, and I also have the freedom to tinker the filesystem the way I wish without being worried of breaking something or polluting anything.
